for every self.wfile.write(bytes("code") there's only 2 variables that you can create
examaple:
  self.wfile.write(bytes("<h1>Hello</h1>", "utf-8")

', "utf-8" ' is the heart of every code, without that, all codes will be done, but without this the code in except will not work

like for creating a page with a centered text:

  self.wfile.write(bytes("<html><head><title>HostENV python server</title></head>", "utf-8"))
  self.wfile.write(bytes("<body><h1 style=","utf-8"))
  self.wfile.write(bytes("text-align:center>" , "utf-8"))
  self.wfile.write(bytes("Welcome to the HostENV python server</h1></body></html>", "utf-8"))
